<h3>How to use the Drupal QA Checklist</h3>
<p>The following will help in your use of the QA Checklist.</p>

<h4>Information</h4>

<p>This module was written for Drupal site builders, developers, and System administrators or anyone else in charge of launching a Drupal site. The tasks within represent a comprehensive list of things to review and tasks to perform before going live. If you need help, or this list doesn't make any sense to you, we suggest hiring a Drupal development shop like [WebOzy](http://webozy.com/) or others listed in the [Marketplace](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-services).</p>

<h4>A bit about checklists</h4>

<p>Each time you open the QA Checklist, it will look to see if any tasks have already been completed. You still need to click "Save" to time and date stamp the automatically-checked items.</p>

<p>The tasks here are designed to be done sequentially, from top to bottom.</p>

<h4>How this works</h4>

<p>lorem</p>

<h4>Don't do it all</h4>

<p>Not every task in this list needs to, or even should, be done. Some of this will rely on your web host or PAAS provider. Using a Drupal-optimized provider such as [Pantheon](https://www.getpantheon.com/) or [Acquia](http://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-cloud) means that much of this list is already completed. Sit back and enjoy some iced tea. For standard web hosts, you may want to ask about the availability of certain features.</p>
